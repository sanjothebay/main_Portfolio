# Unit 08 Project 1 Homework: Professional Materials
Now that you've had some practice with APIs and have a project to share, you'll be updating your portfolio page and other materials to build toward being employer-competitive.
If you are opting out of career services, this is _still a required assignment_. Part of being a web developer means being a part of a community. Having a place to share your projects is _necessary_ if you're applying for jobs, but it's also _critical_ on your journey as a developer.

## Requirements
* Submit an updated portfolio featuring Project 1 and two exemplary homework assignments.
* Submit an updated GitHub profile with pinned repositories featuring Project 1 and two exemplary assignments.
* Submit an updated resume
* Submit an updated LinkedIn profile

I notice that my old Portfilo was very plain and simpl and I wanted to jump out a bit. I redid my portfolio. Im Still New to Coding. I was able to Find somethig that 
I kinda liked but needed things fixed. Durig my Project1 One of my team mates use bd-grid for the responsiveness. So This was aslo use with the built of this project
as it aslo give a nice margin. Afetr doing my other Porfolio numerous times I was able to use some of the code that i had, but made alot of changes to my likings. 

Portfolio has the Followig:
   * A navbar
   * A responsive layout
   * Responsive images
   * Functional, deployed application
   * All links work
   * Downloadable Resume
   *personalized information (bio, name, images, links to social media, etc.).
   * Using grid system (responsiveness).
   
The navigatewill Guide the end-users to the corresponding part of teh web page.
I also choosed a Hambuger Menu for the Mobile responsiveness.Checking to see how it would look in each window size.
Making sure throughout each change of each process the web worked great without any errors before committing to the change. 
I went to https://scrollrevealjs.org/ where i was abe to use a scroll navigation. This was seen in a youtube tutorial.
I dicided to use this as it made my portfolio more actrative.
I added the icons whitch I also linked My web pages in order for the end-user to visite and see my profiles. 
I added the icons in the start of the porfolio and at the bottom to make it look more professional.

I added my section to have the and user see what i have done. I added a simple graph, I use te with to make the graph.
I made this very simple as im still learing but goodle alot to get things right. The section added were About, Skill, Work Contact.
I wanted to add this section so the end-user know what my skills are. I added the picture of my computer. This was to show user that im
able to do the work from home.

In my work section I added my assignments I have completed as well up and running. This section has the Images and linkes to both the
Deployed app and the Repo. I made the icons we when you hiver over them they change color indicating a link. 
I also added my personal information in order for people to contact me directly.
I wanted to do the same as my other portfolio. Were I was able to get the Html form to a Google Doc. This Time i was unable to. 
I did asked for help in the ASKBCS but they said they dont do nothing with Google. So they closed my ticket. 
I asked my tutor and she said try the form to emial. This is what I ended up using and i was able to get the users input to an email 
sent to me.

links are all workin and takes you to the corerct page. To top it off the contact page works with my email and im able to get the

## Instructions
1. [Updated Portfolio](#updated-portfolio)
2. [GitHub Profile](#updated-github-profile)
3. [Updated Resume](#updated-resume)

## Updated Portfolio
üíÅ Need help updating your Portfolio? Check out the [Career Services milestone resources for online presence](hhttps://sites.google.com/2u.com/careerservices-webdev/coding-milestones/milestone-polish-online-presence).

Your updated portfolio should:

1. Display your full name, email, and phone number
2. Have links to your GitHub profile and LinkedIn profile
3. Have a link to a downloadable PDF of your resume
4. Display at least 2 examples of student work from either deployed projects or homeworks. For each project, make sure you have the following:

    * Project title
    * Link to the deployed version
    * Link to the GitHub repository
    * Screenshot of the deployed application

5. Have a polished, mobile-responsive user interface.

### Design
Unfortunately, this is where it gets a little bit subjective. Your site should look
"polished." Here are a few guidelines on what that means:

* Mobile-first design
* Choose a color palette for your site so it doesn't just look like
  the default bootstrap theme or an unstyled HTML site.
* Make sure the font size is large enough to read, and that the colors don't cause eye strain.

## Updated GitHub Profile
Employers (and potential collaborators) _will_ look at your GitHub profile, so put your best face forward. 
Your GitHub profile must contain at least the following items:
1. Professional profile picture
   * A photo or an image other than the default Github identicon. (a semi-professional to professional photo or an avatar photo are preferred)
2. Biography
3. Your current location
4. Email address
5. Link to your deployed portfolio

6. At least 2 pinned repositories:

   * Navigate to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and go to your profile.
   * Click "Customize your pins"
   * Click the checkboxes for your project and 2-3 homework assignments that you would like to share
7. Follow a few of your classmates. They are the beginning of your professional network and being a developer is as much about being a part of the community as it is writing code.

8. README files. Every pinned project should contain a README file with:

   * Title of app
   * Live link to deployed app
   * List of technologies used
   * 1-2 sentences explaining what the app is
   * 2-3 Screenshots / gifs of the app
   * License (usually MIT)
   * Contact information for you and any collaborators

9. Commit history. Every pinned repository should have at least 20 commits.
